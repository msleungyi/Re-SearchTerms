# Re-SearchTerms: A Shiny App for Navigating Open Scholarship Terms

This repository contains:
- **Code for Shiny App**: The Shiny app code for visualising the relationships between open-scholarship and research terms and their definitions. Check the directory "app".
- **Raw Dataset, Codes for Text Preprocessing & Linguistic Analysis**: The datasets used in the analysis. Check the directory "data".
- **Live App**: Access our Shiny app [here](https://msleungyi.shinyapps.io/Re-SearchTerms/).

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required R packages (listed in `app.R`).
3. Run the app using `shiny::runApp('app.R')`.

## Preprint Availability
The preprint associated with this Shiny app, titled "Re-SearchTerms: A Shiny app for navigating open scholarship terms" by Anna Yi Leung, Daniel Kristanto, and Xenia Schmalz, is available [here](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/qsp7x). This manuscript is hosted on OSF Preprints and includes detailed descriptions of the methodology and applications presented in this app.

## Acknowledgements
