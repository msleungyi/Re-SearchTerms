A variety of meta-analytic approaches exist, including random or fixed effects models or meta-regressions, which allow for an examination of moderator effects. By aggregating data from multiple studies, a meta-analysis could provide a more precise estimate for a phenomenon (e.g. type of treatment) than individual studies. Results are usually visualized in a forest plot. Meta-analyses can also help examine heterogeneity across study results. Meta-analyses are often carried out in conjunction with systematic reviews and similarly require a systematic search and screening of studies.

When the knowledge of a domain is represented in a declarative formalism, the set of objects that can be represented is called the universe of discourse. This set of objects, and the describable relationships among them, are reflected in the representational vocabulary with which a knowledge-based program represents knowledge. Thus, we can describe the ontology of a program by defining a set of representational terms. In such an ontology, definitions associate the names of entities in the universe of discourse (e.g., classes, relations, functions, or other objects) with human-readable text describing what the names are meant to denote, and formal axioms that constrain the interpretation and well-formed use of these termsLearn more in: Context Modelling Approaches for Mobile Systems",ontology explicit specification conceptualization term borrowed philosophy ontology systematic account existence knowl based systems exists exactly can represented knowl domain represented declarative formalism set objects can represented called universe discourse set objects describable relationships among reflected representational vocabulary knowl based program represents knowl thus can describe ontology program defining set representational terms ontology definitions associate names entities universe discourse classes relations functions objects human readable text describing names meant denote formal axioms constrain interpretation well formed use terms,Ontology (Artificial Intelligence)_111

It seeks to describe or posit the basic categories and relationships of being or existence to define entities and types of entities within its frame work. In Greek philosophy, ontology means understanding the eternal reality (Reginald, 1985). Plato defined the reality as primary and the perception and experience of reality as secondary. Socrates held the similar view that the purpose of learning was to recognize eternal truth and therefore the instruction was to remind someone of something already known and accepted as true (Spector, 2001). This classical view of ontology has changed due to a realization that the explication and uncovering of external reality involve human perceiver and that human judgment with respect to such uncovering is subject to error. One of the assumptions of modern ontology is that instruction should focus on bodies of knowledge rather than individual knowledge. Instead of relying on one-to-one correspondence between individual beliefs and external reality, the modern ontology proposes a coherence theory of truth in which acceptance or rejection of new beliefs should be based on how well new beliefs fit with and how coherent they are with the established beliefs (Quine & Ullian, 1978; Spector, 2001). This assumption is important in that it influences the formation of ontology in computer science in which the shared conceptualization of reality across knowledge domains is emphasized.Learn more in: An Ontological Approach to Online Instructional Design",term ontology essentially refers study existence seeks describe posit basic categories relationships existence define entities types entities within frame work greek philosophy ontology means understanding eternal reality plato defined reality primary perception experience reality secondary socrates held similar view purpose learning recognize eternal truth therefore instruction remind someone something already known accepted true classical view ontology changed due realization explication uncovering external reality involve human perceiver human judgment respect uncovering subject error one assumptions modern ontology instruction focus bodies knowl rather individual knowl instead relying one one correspondence individual beliefs external reality modern ontology proposes coherence theory truth acceptance rejection new beliefs based well new beliefs fit coherent established beliefs quine ullian spector assumption important influences formation ontology computer science shared conceptualization reality across knowl domains emphasized,Ontology (Artificial Intelligence)_157

Social class is partly a cultural variable, as it is a stable variable and likely to change slowly over the years. Social class can have important implications to academic outcomes. An individual may have a high socio-economic status yet identify as a working class individual. Working class students tend to have different life circumstances and often more restrictive commitments than middle-class students, which make their integration with other students more difficult (Rubin, 2021). The lack of time and money is obstructive to their social experience at university.

A systematic review will usually include a thorough, repeatable (reproducible) search strategy including key terms and databases in order to find relevant literature on a given topic or research question. Systematic reviewers follow a process of screening the papers found through their search, until they have filtered down to a set of papers that fit their predefined inclusion criteria. These papers can then be synthesised in a written review which may optionally include statistical synthesis in the form of a meta-analysis as well. A systematic review should follow a standard set of guidelines to ensure that bias is kept to a minimum for example PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021), Cochrane Systematic Reviews (Higgins et al., 2019), or NIRO-SR (Topor et al., 2021).",form literature review evidence synthesis systematic review will usually include thorough repeatable reproducible search strategy including key terms databases order find relevant literature given topic research question systematic reviewers follow process screening papers found search filtered set papers fit predefined inclusion criteria papers can synthesised written review may optionally include statistical synthesis form meta analysis well systematic review follow standard set guidelines ensure bias kept minimum example prisma moher page cochrane systematic reviews higgins niro sr topor,Systematic Review_1

The Z-curve analysis can be performed in R through a dedicated package - ",computing z score statistical approach mainly used obtain estimated replication rate err expected discovery rate edr set reported studies calculating z curve set statistically significant studies involves converting reported p values z scores fitting finite mixture model distribution z scores estimating mean power based mixture model z curve analysis can performed r dedicated package cran r project org web packages zcurve index html,Z-Curve_1
